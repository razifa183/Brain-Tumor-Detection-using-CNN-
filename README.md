This project is a Django-based web application that allows users to upload MRI scans and detect brain tumors using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

üìå Project Overview

      Tech Stack: Django (Backend) + Bootstrap (Frontend)
      Machine Learning Model: CNN trained using TensorFlow/Keras
      Dataset: Publicly available brain MRI dataset
  
      Classification Categories:

        Glioma Tumor
        Meningioma Tumor
        Pituitary Tumor
        No Tumor (Healthy Brain)

      üöÄ Features

‚úÖ Upload MRI images for tumor detection
‚úÖ Uses a trained CNN model for classification
‚úÖ Supports four tumor categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, No Tumor
‚úÖ User-friendly web interface built with Django
‚úÖ Displays prediction results with an alert message

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend: Django (Python)

Django is a high-level Python web framework used for building scalable applications.

    1) Handles user input (image uploads)

    2) Processes model predictions using views.py

    3) Manages database models using Django ORM

2Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

The web interface is designed using Bootstrap for responsiveness and minimal styling.

   1) HTML templates (templates/) for rendering pages

   2) Bootstrap for styling forms, buttons, and layout

   3) JavaScript for interactive elements

3Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning: TensorFlow/Keras

The brain tumor detection model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

    1) TensorFlow/Keras for building, training, and saving the model

    2) Image processing (resizing, normalization)

    3) Prediction API integrated with Django

4Ô∏è‚É£ Database: SQLite (Default, Can Be Switched)

Django uses SQLite as the default database, but you can configure PostgreSQL or MySQL.

    1) Stores uploaded images and metadata

    2) Manages user sessions

5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Deployment: TensorFlow SavedModel Format (.h5)

    1) The trained CNN model is saved in .h5 format for easy loading in Django.

    2) Predictions are executed on the server-side when users upload MRI images.
